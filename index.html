            <p class="cardheading">lpkbv1 - my first low profile, wireless keyboard</p>
            <p class="cardcontent">This time, for Hack Club Blueprint, I wanted to make a keyboard that had features I
                had never
                experimented in the past with. I have worked with RGB, adding an OLED, Complete QMK-Vial support, yet I
                wanted the challenge of something new. This time, I could've either made a Split keyboard, or something
                different. I prefer my keyboards staggered, and the idea of using a split or olkb freaks me out. That's
                why this time, I decided to make a low profile wireless keyboard. The keyboard itself is quite simple.
                It has a 4000mAh battery, which should hypothetically last around 40hrs of use with BLE. Like my
                previous designs, it's built on the Raspberry Pi Pico, which I am definitely not short of. The RP2040
                chip has served me quite consistently, and is extremely easy to code for in almost all major firmwares.
                I plan on using KMK for this design rather than QMK like my previous designs. This is mainly because QMK
                kind of sucks when combined with a wireless keyboard, especially since it doesn't even support the Pico
                W's BLE capability. KMK however, is built on Circuitpython and has vast support for basically anything I
                want to do. The OLED on the keyboard is also a necessity this time, since I need to know the battery
                percentage and the connection status without using any cables. The battery charges directly through VBUS
                with the flick of a switch, so I don't think there is any issue in that either. I am currently waiting
                on all the parts to arrive before I finish building this keyboard, so check back in a week or two!</p>

            <p class="cardheading">exposedserver</p>
            <p class="cardcontent">exposedserver was my solution to minecraft server admin dashboards. I made it as a
                way to learn Java, server-side minecraft modding and websockets. The premise is simple: Get data, open
                websocket, stream data. Anyone with the mod installed could remotely connect to their server with that
                server's IP, the websocket port, and an access key. I don't plan on continuing development, as the need
                for the mod has been made redundant with the new built-in Server Management Protocol API, although I
                might revisit the idea and implement a GUI similar to the existing one.</p>
